      "body": "It's Saturday, folks. Let's all kick back with a cup of coffee and share some cartoons!\n\nFeel free to share political cartoons in this thread. Besides our usual civility policy, there are three rules to follow:\n\nEvery top-level comment must contain a political cartoon. This means no text-only top-level comments.\n\nIt must be an original cartoon. This means no photographs, no edited cartoons, no memes and no image macros. OC is allowed, as is animation.\n\nEach top-level comment should only have a maximum of 3 cartoons.\n\nThat's all. Enjoy your weekend!",
